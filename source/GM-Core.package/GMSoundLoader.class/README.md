A GMSoundLoader can load sounds from disk and store them in a cache. It supports wav and aiff files.
You can access the sampledSounds directly or play them immediately.
Only one music can be played at a time (but repeating) and paused. 
Multiple sounds can be played at the same time. They are played once.
