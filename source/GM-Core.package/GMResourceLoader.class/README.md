A GMResourceLoader is an abstract Class which bundles shared behaviour of the image and soundloader.
All resources from a folder can be loaded. 
Specific resources can be loaded from a supplied directory.
Resources can be loaded from drive and stored in methods so you don't have to think about external resources.
Objects can be loaded into the cache so you don't have to instantiate them every time you use them.
