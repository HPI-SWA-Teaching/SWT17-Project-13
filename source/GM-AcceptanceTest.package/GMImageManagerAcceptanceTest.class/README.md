Im am an acceptance test for the gmimagehandler. I can be opened like any other morph.

How to use me (also see initialize):
1. get singleton instance from imagemanager
2. load resources from your project asset directory. Images only need to be loaded once into cache.
3. get images previously loaded from the cache using getImageForm: aString
