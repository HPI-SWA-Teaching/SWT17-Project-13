Im am an acceptance test for the GM collision mechanics. I can be opened like any other morph.
I am responsible for presenting how to use gm collision handling.

Once opened I display various morphs. All morphs colored red collide with another morph, the others are colored green.

The most important methods for collision detection are 'initialize' and 'collisionMorphXXXXXX' which display how to prepare a morph for collision, and 'step', which check whether morphs are colliding.
